# SMFnorm
Normalization of accessibility methylation data from genome-wide, single molecule, sequence data such as MAPit, NOMe-seq, Fiber-seq, etc..

# SMFnorm: Single Molecule Footprinting Data Normalization Package

## Overview
SMFnorm is a specialized R package designed for normalizing methylation data from genome-wide footprinting, such as MAPit-CpGiant or MAPit-RRBS, NOMe-seq or Fiber-seq. It implements a sophisticated quantile-bin shrinkage normalization process that addresses technical variation between replicates while preserving biological signals.

## Core Functions

### Data Loading and Preparation
load_data(): Efficiently loads and processes methylation call files with both C++ and R implementations
- C++ implementation provides up to 85% faster loading times
- Graceful fallback to pure R when C++ compilation isn't available
- Optional parallel processing with multiple cores
- Flexible sample selection through a sample sheet format
- Handles both GCH and HCG methylation contexts
- Supports filtering by group IDs for targeted analysis
- Performs initial data validation and organization
- Returns a structured list of samples with attached metadata

### Performance
The package implements a high-performance C++ reader that can significantly reduce loading times for large methylation files:

| Implementation | Time per file | Time for 10 files |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| C++ loading    | ~19 seconds   | ~3.5 minutes      |
| R loading      | ~2.5 minutes  | ~25 minutes       |

For users without C++ compilation tools, the package automatically falls back to a pure R implementation, ensuring compatibility across all environments.

### Example Usage to Load
```r
# Load all samples using C++ implementation (default)
all_samples <- load_data(
  dir_path = "path/to/methylation_files/",
  sample_sheet = "sample_metadata.csv"
)

# Load only specific groups
group_samples <- load_data(
  dir_path = "path/to/methylation_files/",
  sample_sheet = "sample_metadata.csv",
  groups = c("M1", "M2")
)

# Filter by type and use pure R implementation
hcg_samples <- load_data(
  dir_path = "path/to/methylation_files/",
  sample_sheet = "sample_metadata.csv",
  type = "HCG",
  use_cpp = FALSE
)

# Load a single file
single_data <- load_single_file(
  single_file = "path/to/methylation_file.gz"
)

```
### Normalization Process

#### 1. Coverage Normalization (`normalize_coverage`)
- Normalizes coverage depth across samples
- Features:
  - Within-group normalization for technical replicates
  - Optional between-group normalization
  - Scaling factor calculation based on total coverage
  - Preserves relative coverage patterns

#### 2. Methylation Rate Normalization (`normalize_methylation_rates`)
- Implements advanced quantile-based normalization with structure preservation
- Key features:
  - Dynamic quantile binning based on dataset size
  - Structure preservation using alpha parameter (default = 0.3)
  - Two-step process:
    - Within-group normalization (technical replicates)
    - Optional between-group normalization (experimental conditions)
  - Preserves biological differences while reducing technical variation

### Visualization and Diagnostics

#### Within-Group Report (`plot_within_group_report`)
- Focused on technical replicate normalization
- Includes:
  - QQ plots comparing replicates
  - Density distributions
  - Multiple visualizations per experimental group

#### Between-Group Report (`plot_between_group_report`)
- Evaluates group-level normalization effects
- Features:
  - Group mean comparisons
  - Distribution plots
  - Box plots showing group-level changes

### Key Features
1. **Efficient Processing**
   - Optimized for large datasets
   - Uses data.table for fast operations
   - Memory-efficient visualization using hexbin plots

2. **Flexible Normalization**
   - Adjustable parameters for different experimental needs
   - Structure preservation to maintain biological signals
   - Independent control of within and between-group normalization

3. **Comprehensive Visualization**
   - Dense data visualization using hexbin plots
   - Separate reports for within and between-group effects
   - Customizable plotting parameters

4. **Quality Control**
   - Diagnostic information during normalization
   - Visual assessment of normalization effects
   - Multiple metrics for evaluating normalization success

## Technical Details

### Normalization Parameters
- `sites_per_quantile`: Controls quantile bin size (default = 1000)
- `within_alpha`: Structure preservation for technical replicates (default = 0.3)
- `between_alpha`: Structure preservation for group differences (default = 0.5)
- Dynamic quantile calculation based on dataset size

### Visualization Options
- Customizable color schemes (viridis color palettes)
- Adjustable bin sizes for density plots
- Optional data sampling for quick visualization
- PDF export capability for reports

## Future Developments
- Additional normalization methods
- Enhanced visualization options
- Performance optimizations for very large datasets
- Extended diagnostic capabilities

## Usage
The package is designed for methylation data analysis workflows, particularly suited for:
- MAPit experimental data
- Multi-group experimental designs
- Datasets with technical replicates
- Large-scale methylation studies

This implementation provides a robust framework for normalizing methylation data while maintaining biological significance and offering comprehensive diagnostic tools for quality assessment.
